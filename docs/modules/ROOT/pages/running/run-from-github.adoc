= Run from GitHub

It is possible to run integrations from GitHub with a dedicated URL
syntax:

```
kamel run github:$user/$repo/$path?branch=$branch
```

As example, running the following command

```
kamel run github:apache/camel-k/examples/Sample.java
```

is equivalent to:

```
kamel run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/camel-k/master/examples/Sample.java
```

but does not require to type the full GitHub RAW URL.

Declaring the branch query param is not required and defaults to `master` if not explicit set.
