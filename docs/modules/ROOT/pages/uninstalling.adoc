= Uninstalling Camel K

If you really need to, it is possible to completely uninstall Camel K from OpenShift or Kubernetes with the following command:

[source]
----
kamel uninstall
----

This will uninstall from the cluster namespace all Camel K resources along with the operator.

NOTE:  By _default_ the resources possibly shared between clusters such as https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources[CustomResourceDefinitions (CRD)], https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac[ClusterRole] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/applications/operators/olm-understanding-olm.html[Operator Lifecycle Manager(OLM)] will be  **excluded**. To force the inclusion of all resources you can use the **--all** flag.

To verify that all resources have been removed you can use the following command:

[source]
----
kubectl get all,pvc,configmap,rolebindings,clusterrolebindings,secrets,sa,roles,clusterroles,crd -l 'app=camel-k'
No resources found in default namespace.
